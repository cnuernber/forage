(defn fournierize
  "Given a sequence of coordinate pairs (points), returns a sequence containing
  those points and \"fournier children\", i.e. points that are (* sep multiplier)
  up, down, left, and to the right of each original point.  Then iterates,
  performing the same operation on all of the points at a smaller scale, levels
  times.  multiplier should be < 1.  (Note that the number of points is increased
  exponentially, multiplying by 5 each time.)"
