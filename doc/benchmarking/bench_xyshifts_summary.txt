Summary of results from time benchmarking variations in intra-seg-epsilons
and discretization of Continuous2D with foodspots on a rectangular
grid (with perceived radius 5 and 1):

Tests using getNeighborsExactlyWithinDistance():

. Differences in discretizations, from 2Xradius to distances between
foodspots, make no sigificant difference in speed.

. The speed of search is inversely proportional to the value of the
intra-seg-epsilons.

. Initial tests show discretizations from 1/5 of a radius on down find the
same foodspots, but need to test that further.

-----------------------

. A preliminary test shows that getNeighborsWithinDistance() takes roughly
1/3 as long as the Exactly function.

(This function would be unsuitable for randomly placed foodspots,
because it can returns foodspots outside of perc-radius.  However, for
foodspots on a rectangular grid, and a Continuous2D discretization size
such that there will never be more than one foodspot in a cell, this
function is just as good as the Exactly version.)

. Doing a linear search through all foodspots, extracting them from
the env, is *very* slow with env-size=1000, food-distance=100,
perc-radius=1.
