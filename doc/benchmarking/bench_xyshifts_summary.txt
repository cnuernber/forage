Summary of results from time benchmarking variations in intra-seg-epsilons
and discretization of Continuous2D with foodspots on a rectangular
grid (with perceived radius 5 and 1):

Differences in discretizations, from 2xradius to distances between
foodspots, make no sigificant difference in speed.

The speed of search is inversely proportional to the value of the
intra-seg-epsilons.

(Question: Should I try the linear search that the MASON manual
suggests?)

Initial tests show discretizations from 1/5 of a radius on down find the
same foodspots, but need to test that further.
