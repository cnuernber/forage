At an earlier stage I was imaginging that my experiments would just
look at the first food found, and then start over.

Recently I have been instead thinking that I'd count food found over
the course of an entire path.

But that doesn't really make sense, realistically, because it assumes
that when an animal finds food, it continues on in the same direction.
Would it do that?  Why would it do that?  Why not start over at that
point?

So maybe I should go back to the old idea.  But this way:

Measure how far animal has to go to find a foodspot, up to a max
distance.  Finding after a shorter path is fitter.
