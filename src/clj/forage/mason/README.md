forage/mason/
===
Directory for lib functions for working with MASON.

foodspot.clj can be used for foodspot lookup, whether or not
in a full MASON ABM.

The *incomplete* subdir contains partial attempts to set up a full
MASON ABM.  It's not really needed for my initial foraging
simulations.  I thought I might set it up in order to display paths
toroidally, but then decided it would be easier to do that by hand
with Vega-Lite, so put that off and put the files in *incomplete* to
avoid confusion.  Then it turned out that toroidal display with Vega-Lite
is more trouble than I thought, so that's on hold, too.
