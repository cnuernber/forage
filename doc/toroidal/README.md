toroidal
===

This directory contains documentation and illustrations concerning
functions in the `forage.toroidal` namespace.  These are functions
that take a sequence of point coordinates representing the path of
a walk, and manipulate them so that they can be perceived as
"wrapping" around in a toroidal world, i.e. one with periodic boundary
conditions.

* exceedingboundaries1.pdf: Illustration of some ideas in toroidal.clj.

* exceedingboundaries1.gcx: MacOS Grapher sourse file for preceding.

* unmod7790000679590803178.*: Plot of an initial, unmodified LÃ©vy walk.

* loose7790000679590803178.*: Plot of the same walk after manipulations,
  showing the full extent of the line segments.

* tight7790000679590803178.jpg: Like loose7790000679590803178.jpg, but
  with the image constrained so that only the parts inside the
  original world boundaries are visible.  This is the ultimate goal
  of a visual representation of toroidal wrapping, usually.
