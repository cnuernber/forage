;; MORE NOTES ON xy-shifts:
;; It works when there's not a NaN, *but* the x-eps, y-eps correspond 
;; to a value for eps, even when eps is negative.  That's because
;; I'm using sqrt bare, and it always returns the positive root.  But that's
;; OK: the x-eps, y-eps will push in the correct direction. BUT: yo-shifts,
;; i.e. xy-shifts passing minus to quadratic-formula, pushes in a different
;; direction.
;; AND xy-shifts with plus passed to q-f, is sometimes *wrong* about direction.
;; even though the eps size along the line would be right.
;; but sometimes yo-shifts is the one that's wrong.
;; but sometimes they both seem right.
;;
;; Suppose I try this: Take abs val of everything and add back neg signs
;; as needed later.
;; Assume eps is always positive.
;; But note that I know slope in xy-shifts, but I don't know direction
;; of the vector.  So that happens outside it.
