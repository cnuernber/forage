* If you add an "ord" key with numeric values to a sequence of maps
representing endpionts of line segments, they'll be plotted in order
of the values of the "ord" field.

* If you want to plot two such sequences of segments, it appears that you
have to plot them separately.  You can't just e.g. restart the ordering.
I think what happens then is that the 1's are with the 1's, 2's with
2's, etc.--so you get lines going back and forth between the two sets of
lines.  So you have to layer two plots, apparently, to get two separate
line sequences.

* I thought I could clip extreme path segments from a vega-lite plot
  using "autosize": "none".  But it seems to be too extreme.  It does
  the job, but also clips my header text and the legend.  Maybe
  there's a way, but I don't yet see how.
