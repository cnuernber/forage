hanami foodspot size is wrong

Sometimes getting NaN in food searches. never returns.
I think this is in find-in-seg.

at least with debug printlns, long horiz or vertical flights are slow since
foodspots not found--will it be slow in general when foodspots are sparser?

I THINK THESE ARE THE SAME PROBLEM:
It's not that it always skips the first one, it's that
when the endpoint is negative, the slope is in the wrong direction.

	What about the question I put as a comment on xy-shifts?

	I think find-in-seg starts searching from the second stop;
	i.e. it's not searching between first and second.

	look at the following example.  xsh, ysh should be passed
	to next iteration, but because the x endpoint is negative, it's
	passed to next iteration, since it's less than xsh.
