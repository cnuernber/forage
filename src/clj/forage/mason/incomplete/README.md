forage/mason/incomplete
===

This directory contains partial attempts to set up a full MASON ABM.
It's not really needed for my initial foraging simulations.  I thought I
might set it up in order to display paths toroidally, but then decided
it would be easier to do that by hand with Vega-Lite, so put that off
and put the files in *incomplete* to avoid confusion.
