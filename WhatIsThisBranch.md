This is branch **main**, formerly **origin-in-corner**.

Some history:

Up until 2/16/2022, I had a single branch, **main**, and I always put
the origin (0,0) in the center of the environment.  I was having trouble
implementing toroidal paths for display in Vega-Lite.  The origin in the
center seemed to complicate that.  I decided to try putting the origin
in the corner (lower left), and created **origin-in-corner** for that
purpose.  As of 2/18/2022, although I hadn't gotten toroidal display
working (despite some apparent progress), I decided to continue placing
the origin in the corner going forward, so I replaced **main** with
**origin-in-corner**.  (The previous version of **main** is now
preserved in branch **origin-in-center**, and the **origin-in-corner**
branch preserves the state before the merge.)
