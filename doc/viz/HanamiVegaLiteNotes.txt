If you add an "ord" key with numeric values to a sequence of maps
representing endpionts of line segments, they'll be plotted in order
of the values of the "ord" field.

If you want to plot two such sequences of segments, it appears that you
have to plot them separately.  You can't just e.g. restart the ordering.
I think what happens then is that the 1's are with the 1's, 2's with
2's, etc.--so you get lines going back and forth between the two sets of
lines.  So you have to layer two plots, apparently, to get two separate
line sequences.
